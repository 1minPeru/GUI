# GUI
A small GUI that takes an order for a smartphone and prints receipt as a file.

Just download all of the files into a java project in eclipse or your favorite IDE.

Run FoneOrder.java and after selecting your choices and inputting your data into the textboxes, hitting Ctrl+S or selecting save in the menu will alter the PhoneOrder.txt file to be the reciept of your order.

This project was a small project I worked on during Senior Year of highschool.
