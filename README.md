# GUI
A small GUI that takes an order for a smartphone and prints receipt as a file.

FoodOrder and the FoneOrder are essentially the same, except the method in which they are printing.

FoodOrder (named incorrectly) edits the PhoneOrder.txt file.

I'm trying to make the FoneOrder.java print the reciept as a .txt file to a folder of your choice.
